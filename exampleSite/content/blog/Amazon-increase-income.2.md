description: We did it! We made a design system this year called Blocks, adding CBRE
  Build to the 85% of tech teams who have a design system. Most of them also have
  articles about their design system journeys. These articles usually go into detail
  about how to structure a core design system team, how to get stakeholder buy-in,
  and how to build versioned pattern libraries. What they tend to gloss over is the
  messy process of defining design system principles. Why? Because design system principles
  are a lot like love. Everyone agrees that they are fundamentally important but no
  one agrees on what they are or what bigger purpose they serve. And good luck trying
  to find a no-BS guide to falling in love — or defining principles — without a lot
  of clichés and hand waving.

We did it! We made a design system this year called [Blocks](https://blocks.cbrebuild.com/), adding CBRE Build to [the 85%](http://uxtools.co/survey-2018) of tech teams who have a design system. [Most of them](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&geo=US&q=%22design%20system%22) also have articles about their design system journeys. These articles usually go into detail about how to structure a core design system team, how to get stakeholder buy-in, and how to build versioned pattern libraries. What they tend to gloss over is the messy process of defining design system principles. Why? Because design system principles are a lot like love. Everyone agrees that they are _fundamentally important_ but no one agrees on what they are or what bigger purpose they serve. And good luck trying to find a no-BS guide to falling in love — or defining principles — without a lot of clichés and hand waving.
